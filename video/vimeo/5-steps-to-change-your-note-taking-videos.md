Video: 5 Steps to Change your Note Taking
---

I've recently been speaking at a few conferences and I thought I'd try out a new format... instead of using slides, I live sketched my presentation and invited people to sketch along, learning the basic priniciples of sketchnoting while they where doing it themselves and walking away with a nice sketched summary of the talk. 

I think it worked out quite well, but you can judge for yourself as the talks were recorded. You can find the recording from [Smashing Conference Freiburg here](https://vimeo.com/184237603). The one from Frontend conf in Zurich is embedded below.

And here is the final 'slide' from my talk:

`I ALSO GAVE A GERMAN VERSION OF THE TALK FOR A CARLSEN VERLAG IN HAMBURG. UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS NO VIDEO RECORDING, BUT AT LEAST THE FINAL SKETCH.`

At both occasions, I asked the audience to sketch along and tweet their final sketchnotes of the talk. It is great to see the resulting variety of people's work. Below are a few examples.

If you are sketching along, why not share you sketchnote on twitter and mention me (@evalottchen) so I can see what you did. :)
